This app by Samuel P. Folledo will essentially do the following:
1) Listen for speech (recording functionalities in the future) and grabs the most complicated word in a sentence.
2) Display the top 3 most complicated word and give it an image and definition or explanation

This app's User Interfaces will be programmed in Swift and apply Data Science's TF IDF algorithm in order to present the most complicated word.
    - From here, we can go back to Swift and present our Google/Wikipedia search results for the returned "complicated word"
    
    
Important things to know to program this:
- log or log<sub>b</sub>n = p //log base b of some number n = p
    - is base raise to the of p
